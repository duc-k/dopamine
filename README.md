  <h1><b>Dopamine Theme</b></h1>
</div>

<p>Dopamine is an inspiration from the Dracula theme, which despite all its beauty, has a background color that doesn't please everyone. A major factor for this fork is the lack of a light version, which makes sense as it's a Dark theme. But if like me from time to time you get tired of the dark theme, the lack of a light theme with the same color Highlight was an essential factor for this creation.</p>

<p>ðŸš§ The theme is still in the construction stage, with colors being tested and defined to bring the highest level of comfort to the eyes.</p>
